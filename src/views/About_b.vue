        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
          While humanity at large has made great strides in various fields such
          as medicine, education and life expectancy, this progress is not
          without great cost to our world. We need to be taking care of the
          world for future generations, and as such it's vital that we educate
          young people on topics relating to sustainability because, as a WPI
          professor explains, “[they] are going to be the ones to deal with it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          WPI first years are expected to make a 4-year plan that maps their
          schedules to a set of graduation requirements. Unfortunately, while
          designing these plans, learning about sustainability is not a factor
          in their selections. The Climate Crisis, increased poverty and
          inequalities emphasize how essential learning about sustainability is.
          The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher
          Education explains that “the classroom (is) the true battleground for
          change,” but WPI students do not realize how many courses cover
          sustainability, and some WPI faculty lack the resources to integrate
          sustainability into their curricula.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project aims to promote sustainability in education for WPI
          faculty and students. We interviewed faculty who already teach
          sustainability themed curriculum and surveyed their students to find
          out what sustainability topics are currently being covered at WPI and
          what topics students want to learn about. We used this information to
          generate our deliverable: a website that serves both students and
          faculty. It allows for students to filter through sustainable courses
          by subject or sustainability topic. It allows faculty to have easy
          access to ways sustainability can be integrated in curriculum,
          potential help for doing so, and the student interest in
          sustainability topics and delivery methods.

        <p>
          We chose to categorize the sustainability themed courses further
          according to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The
          Sustainable Development Goals are 17 goals that were announced as part
          of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We chose to use these
          goals as categories for mapping sustainability because these goals
          encompass a wide array of topics. We believe that each sustainability
          themed course should relate in some way to one or more SDG. WPI's
          Office of Sustainability has also expressed interest in promoting the
          Sustainable Development Goals in curricula.

        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
          Our team is composed of three WPI undergraduate students: Emily Baker, Rui Huang and Akash Shaji.
          We completed this project in order to fulfill our Interactive Qualifying Project Requirement (IQP). 
          Our team was scheduled to complete our IQP at the University of Worcester in Worcester, UK, 
          but due to COVID-19 we were required to do our project remotely instead. This still ended up being a 
          rewarding experience as we got to spend this term focused on solving an issue much closer to home.
