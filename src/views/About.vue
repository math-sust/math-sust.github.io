        <h1>About This Web Site </h1>
        <p>
          This website serves  to help provide information for students and faculty on SDGs in courses at WPI.  
          The site allows students to filter through sustainable courses
          by subject or sustainability topic, and provides faculty with information on easy
          access to ways in which sustainability can be integrated in curriculum. This includes 
          some resources to help with this process, and info on student interest in
          sustainability topics and delivery methods. The site was developed by a student project team interested in promoting the SDGs, and sustainability in education for WPI faculty and students. The students interviewed faculty who teach
          sustainability themed curriculum. The surveyed students to find
          out what sustainability topics are currently being covered at WPI and
          what topics students want to learn about, and then used this information to
          help them in the development of this web site.

        <h1>About the Students who Initially Developed this Web Site</h1>

        <p>
          Thanks to the team of three WPI undergraduate students who developed the foundation for this site. The students were: Emily Baker, Rui Huang and Akash Shaji. They completed this project in order to fulfill their Interactive Qualifying Project Requirement (IQP). The team was scheduled to complete their IQP at the University of Worcester in Worcester, UK, but due to COVID-19 they were required to do their project remotely instead. This still ended up being a 
          rewarding experience as they spent their term focused on addressing an important issue much closer to home.
